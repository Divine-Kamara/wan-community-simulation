# WAN-Based Community Network Simulation using NS-3 (WAN ASSIGNMENT 2)

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how a Wide Area Network (WAN) can be used to interconnect geographically separated community institutions such as a clinic, school, municipal office, and data center.
The network is designed using a star-based WAN topology where all remote nodes connect to a central router through point-to-point links.

## Network Topology
- 1 Central Router
- 4 Remote Nodes (Community Institutions)
- Point-to-Point WAN Links
- UDP-based communication

## Simulation Tools
- NS-3
- NetAnim (for visualization)

## Simulation Video
The execution of the simulation and the network visualization can be viewed in the video below:

## How to Run the Simulation
```bash
./ns3 run scratch/wan-simulation.cc
